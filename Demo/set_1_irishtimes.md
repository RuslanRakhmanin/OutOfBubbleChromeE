The two had reportedly been in a relationship which had broken down.

The Irish embassy in Malta confirmed it is aware an Irish man has been killed by police.

The body of Ms Ghirxi, who was from Malta, was found at 2am on Monday in her apartment. Mr Johnston was shot dead by police near the Hilton Hotel, in the town of St Julian’s about 6km away.

Both scenes have been sealed off by investigators pending a forensic examination.

During a press conference on Monday morning, Maltese Police said Mr Johnston was brandishing a replica firearm when he was shot dead. He was shot three times after pointing the replica pistol at officers.

Mr Johnston first came to the attention of authorities when he went to the Hilton Hotel at midnight and asked for a drink. When told the bar was closed, he pulled out a weapon and started threatening staff. Police officers responded and Mr Johnston told them he has killed someone

At that stage police went to Ms Ghirxi’s apartment and forced their way in. They found her body with multiple knife wounds. Two knives were found at the scene.

Police negotiators spoke to Mr Johnston for several hours on the shoreline behind the hotel, attempting to convince him to put the weapon down. On one occasion he went into the sea and held the replica gun to his head. Police say they opened fire when he pointed the weapon at officers. Mr Johnston was wounded and later died in hospital.

Maltese Police Commissioner Angelo Gafa said the shooting took place in complete darkness and it was impossible for officers to determine that the gun was a replica. He said officers opened fire as it was deemed to be a life-threatening situation.

Mr Gafa said Ms Ghirxi and the dead man had previously been in a relationship which had broken down. Ms Ghirxi had made a number of complaints to police alleging Mr Johnston had been harassing her. However, Mr Gafa said she told police she did not feel in danger.

Local media has reported Mr Johnston was a former soldier. It is understood he had been living outside of Malta for a time before the murder.

In a statement, the Department of Foreign Affairs is aware of the case and is providing consular assistance. “As with all consular cases, the Department does not comment on the details of individual cases,” it said.

The Irish embassy in Malta said its role is to assist any relatives of the dead man who may come forward.
